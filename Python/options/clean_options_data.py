Issues to handle
1. Rescaling so all options are in the same units
2. Rescaling when options changes units after certain dates
3. Missing values - discard entire day
4. Bad options data - plot surface, check for spikes
5. Bad options data - significantly fewer or more options on one day
6. Deviated put/call delta from ATM underlying - solve for implied underlying price
7. For commodity options, ensure underlying expiration is before option expiration
8. Options on one day are the same as previous day
9. Limit orders - check volume
10. Bad options data - plot surface, check for spikes
11. Bad options data - significantly fewer or more options on one day
